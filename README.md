# Provincial Park Information API 
These are 2 APIs that shows you information about Manitoba's Provincial Parks. 
1. Campground Search API 
   * The first API is a campground search API. You will be able to search for available campsites in a specific Provincial Park. All you need is the park name at which you're interested in staying, the start date of your stay, and the end date. 
   * Example: I want to stay in Bird's Hill Park between April 20th and April 21st. The API will search all campsites in Bird's Hill Park and return those that are not yet reserved during that date range. 
2. Specific Park Information API
   * The second API gives you detailed information about a specific park. 
   * You provide the name of Provincial Park and the API will return interesting information about that park. 
   * Information returned includes number of campsites, number of hiking trails, presence of a beach, etc.
